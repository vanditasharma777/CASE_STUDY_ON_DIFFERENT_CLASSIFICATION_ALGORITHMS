# CASE_STUDY_ON_DIFFERENT_CLASSIFICATION_ALGORITHMS
In this case study, I have trained different machine learning classification algorithms on two datasets.
The datasets that I use here are MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset and CIFAR10 Object Classification dataset. 
Both datasets consist of ten classes each.
Both datasets are trained on machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and CNN. 
The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are also observed for each algorithm.
